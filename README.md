# My WebGL Portfolio
---
### Tech Stack:
- All 3D rendering is done using the WebGL API with no libraries/wrappers.
- Written in TypeScript.
---
## Features:
- Ocean generation using normal maps with random sampling over time to simulate the reflection of sunlight from water waves (No vertices are actually moving - highly peformant).
- Realistic sky using a Sky Dome with a custom shader that considers the properties of light and its interaction with out atmopshere, such as Rayleigh scattering.
