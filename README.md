# My WebGL Portfolio
---
### Tech Stack:
- All 3D rendering is done using the WebGL API with no libraries/wrappers.
- Written in TypeScript.
---
## Features:
- Ocean generation using normal maps with random sampling over time to simulate the reflection of sunlight from water waves.
- Realistic sky using a Sky Dome with a custom shader that considers the properties of light and its interaction with our atmopshere, such as Rayleigh scattering.
- Custom SLERP functions to transition position coordinates from A to B with easing.
